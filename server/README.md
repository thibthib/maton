# 📡 maton-server

This module is the one receiving measures from the probes and storing them.

## ➡️ Dependencies
### socket.io
This allows to communicate with other parts of the application pretty easily. I never used it before, and  really like it so far.

### nedb
This is like a local MongoDB database, which is used here for storing the measures.
